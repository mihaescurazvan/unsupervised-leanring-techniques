# unsupervised-learning-techniques


This is one of the projects I work on as I follow Aurelien Geron's Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow, Copyright 2019 Aurélien Géron, 978-1-492-03264-9. You can get yourself a copy of the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291).

## Project scope

In this project we will try to accommodate with the **unsupervised learning techniques**, using different models such as K-Means, DBSCAN and Gaussian mixture models and others while tackling some common datasets. The scope is to use these models for practicing different algorithms such as: **clustering**, **anomaly detection**, **density estimation**.

## Project overview 

* We used K-Means algorithm for **image segmentation**, **preprocessing**,  **semi-supervised learning**
* We trained the DBSCAN algorithm on the make_moons dataset
* Also tried other clustering algorithms such as **Agglomerative clustering** and **Spectral Clustering**
* Then we used the Gaussian Mixtures for **anomaly detection**

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib  
**ML Book:** https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291

## Training Process 

* K-Means
* DBSCAN
